# Contributing to ElGap

First off, thank you for considering contributing. Itâ€™s people like you that make the open-source community such an amazing place.

We welcome any type of contribution, not just code. You can help with documentation, find bugs, or suggest new features.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
-   Before creating a bug report, please check our [issues list](https://github.com/elgap/YOUR_REPO/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.
-   If you're creating a new bug report, please provide a clear title and description, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements
-   We love new ideas. Please open an issue with the tag `[Enhancement]` to start a discussion about your proposed feature. We value discussion and collaboration before implementation.

### Pull Requests
1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Please write clean, readable code and adhere to the existing code style.
3.  Ensure your code is well-commented, especially in tricky areas.
4.  Update the `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` if your changes require it.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Code of Conduct
We have a simple code of conduct: **Be respectful.** This is an artisan's workshop. We are all here to learn and to build great things together.

Thank you!
